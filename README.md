#### About

I do technical web applications development, mostly with PHP, not just brochureware websites but more complex integrations.

Primarily I regard myself as a PHP developer, I just happen to work a lot with both WordPress and Symfony framework, but I'm equally happy to jump onto raw PHP, legacy systems or other frameworks. I think those that look down their nose at WordPress need to spend a couple months working with it to see just how fast and flexible it can be. It doesn't diminish your technical skills any more than say Laravel does. It's a proven platform that lets you get things done _fast_, you bring your own technical skills to those projects you work on, and if you're any good, you'll learn something from every project regardless of the platform.

In recent years I've gotten into Alexa skills, developing skills for several local and national broadcast radio stations and a few private companies including an airport.

Over the years I've done a lot of work in high demand critical systems on multi-server architectures. Architecting server infrastructures to provide high availability/scalability for real-time radio/audio streaming services for national broadcasters. I co-designed and built the system that streamed every English Premiership football match live around the world for talkSPORT Radio.

Using that previous experience I built a command and control application that integrated analogue audio feeds through hardware digital audio encoders and resilient infrastructure to enable the live broadcast of the German Bundesliga commentary via the Amazon Music platform primarily on Alexa enabled devices.

Following that experience we built an Alexa service that offered subscription based access to every Live English Premier League match for a North American audience.

Other specialities include remote integrations, enabling legacy systems and modern systems to talk to each other through microservices and APIs.
Writing APIs to allow third parties including mobile/tablet app developers to access client data.

Setting standards for technical delivery in terms of quality control, systems control and development processes and practices.
