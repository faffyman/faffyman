#### About

I do technical web applications development, mostly with PHP, not just brochureware websites but more complex integrations.

Primarily I regard myself as a PHP developer, with a preeference for working wth Symfony framework. but also raw PHP, legacy systems, other frameworks, and yeah - WordPress as well.

In recent years I've gotten into Alexa skills, developing skills for several local and national broadcast radio stations and a few private companies including an airport.

Over the years I've done a lot of work in high demand critical systems on multi-server architectures. Architecting server infrastructures to provide high availability/scalability for real-time radio/audio streaming services for national broadcasters. I co-designed and built the system that streamed every English Premiership football match live around the world for talkSPORT Radio.

Using that previous experience I built a command and control application that integrated analogue audio feeds through hardware digital audio encoders and resilient infrastructure to enable the live broadcast of the German Bundesliga commentary via the Amazon Music platform primarily on Alexa enabled devices.

Following that experience we built an Alexa service that offered subscription based access to every Live English Premier League match for a North American audience.

Other specialities include remote integrations, enabling legacy systems and modern systems to talk to each other through microservices and APIs.
Writing APIs to allow third parties including mobile/tablet app developers to access client data.

Setting standards for technical delivery in terms of quality control, systems control and development processes and practices.
